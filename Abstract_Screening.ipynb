Instead of SNH per se, the\\navailability of resources, such as pollen and nectar, may be more\\nrelevant for supporting pest control. Here, we assessed the\\nspatiotemporal variation of multiple insect pests (cereal leaf beetles\\nand aphids) and natural enemies (predators and aphid parasitoids) in\\nwheat fields and their responses to landscape context and flower\\navailability. We combined detailed information on pollen use by natural\\nenemies with the specific distribution of pollen-providing plants across\\na gradient of landscape composition and configuration. The abundance of\\nwheat pests was tightly linked to wheat development stage. Syrphids\\ncolonised the fields early in the season, while the abundance of other\\nenemies increased later in the season. The responses of pests to\\nlandscape structure were variable and, while some pests had low\\nabundances in landscapes with high edge density and SNH cover, Sitobion\\navenae abundance was positively associated with SNH cover. Lacewings,\\nsyrphids and cereal leaf beetles were abundant in landscapes with\\ndiverse and abundant flower resources, whereas the abundance of\\nparasitoids and Nabis sp. was driven by aphid abundance. We detected no\\nsignificant indirect effects of landscape on pests via natural enemies.\\nSynthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the need for\\nconservation biological control to go beyond `one size fits all' and\\nconsider the specific ecology of the involved organisms, even for a\\nsingle crop type. Landscapes with high edge density and flowering woody\\nplants may support natural enemies, in particular syrphids, which\\ncolonised the fields early in the season. Incentives for\\npest-suppressive landscapes should focus on tailored strategies that\\ndisfavour dominant cereal pests and simultaneously enhance natural\\nenemies according to their ecological requirements.\",\n          \"Land consolidation can negatively affect biodiversity, as it is usually\\nfollowed by the expansion of arable land, a decrease in crop and land\\ncover diversity, and an increase in the application of agrochemicals.\\nThe aim of our study was to compare the species' composition and\\nabundance of farmland birds, as well as habitat structure, on\\nconsolidated and non-consolidated sites in Goricko, NE Slovenia. Habitat\\ndiversity was much lower on consolidated sites compared to\\nnon-consolidated ones, with arable fields and associated habitats (e.g.\\ngrass field margins, field tracks) prevailing on the former.\\nNon-consolidated sites held higher proportions of different types of\\nmeadows, hedgerows, solitary trees, succession and traditional orchards.\\nFarmland bird diversity and the abundance of a majority of farmland bird\\nspecies were higher on non-consolidated sites. The only two exceptions\\nto this were the Eurasian Skylark and the Common Stonechat, which were\\nmore abundant on consolidated sites. Both of the species suffered\\npopulation declines at Goricko in the period 1997-2016, bringing into\\nquestion the suitability of intensively managed arable fields as their\\nbreeding and foraging habitat. Individual species' regression analysis\\nrevealed that the most influential positive explanatory variable for the\\npresence of Red-backed Shrike, Tree Sparrow and Common Whitethroat was\\nnon-consolidated, extensively managed mosaic landscape, whereas for the\\nYellowhammer this explanatory variable was superseded only by forest\\nislands without traditional orchards. Land consolidation, as performed\\nin Slovenia, negatively affects farmland bird diversity and its European\\nconservation value, which is why it should not be performed on Natura\\n2000 sites, designated for nature conservation.\",\n          \"The lack of suitable nesting sites is one key driver behind the farmland\\nbird crisis in Europe. Winter cereals become impenetrable for\\nground-breeding birds like the Eurasian Skylark (Alauda arvensis),\\ncurtailing breeding time. Stable Skylark populations depend on multiple\\nbreeding attempts per year; thus, the widespread cultivation of winter\\ncereals has strongly contributed to their tremendous decline. Crop\\ndiversification is thought to be a potential measure to counteract this\\ndevelopment. Therefore, we explored how individual Skylarks respond to\\nthe decreasing suitability of winter cereals as nesting habitats in\\nheterogeneous but otherwise conventionally managed farmland. Our study\\nfocused on: (i) the degree to which Skylarks prematurely cease nesting\\nactivity, switch nesting habitats, or breed on linear structures like\\ntramlines. Additionally, we analyzed: (ii) if nest success decreases\\nthroughout the breeding season and (iii) how often Skylarks make a\\nsuccessful breeding attempt per year. We radio-tagged 28 adults in a\\nGerman population during April 2018 and 2019, tracked half of them for\\nmore than 3 months, and measured their breeding success. Additionally,\\nwe monitored nests of untagged pairs, resulting in 96 nests found. None,\\nexcept one tagged individual, stopped breeding activity before July 1st.\\nHome ranges were mainly stable, but Skylarks switched nesting habitats\\naway from winter cereals to crops like sugar beet or set-aside.\\nHigh-risk nesting sites like corn and linear structures played a minor\\nrole in breeding.

In this manuscript, multiscale\\nsuperpixel-based approaches are proposed for the fine identification of\\ncrops in the UAV-manned hyperspectral imagery. Specifically, the\\nmultiscale superpixel segmentation is performed and a series of\\nsuperpixel maps can be obtained. Then, the multiscale information is\\nintegrated into image classification by two strategies, namely\\npre-processing and post-processing. For the pre-processing strategy, the\\nsuperpixel is regarded as the minimum unit for image classification,\\nwhose feature is obtained by using the average of spectral values of\\npixels within it. At each scale, the classification is performed on the\\nbasis of the superpixel. Then, the multiscale classification results are\\ncombined to generate the final map. For the post-processing strategy,\\nthe pixel-wise classification is implemented to obtain the label and\\nposterior probabilities of each pixel. Subsequently, the\\nsuperpixel-based voting is conducted at each scale, and these obtained\\nvoting results are fused to generate the multiscale voting result. To\\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, three\\nopen-sourced hyperspectral UAV-manned datasets are employed in the\\nexperiments.

However, for\\nmany agricultural machine learning problems, training datasets are\\ncollected at a specific location, during a specific period in time of\\nthe growing season. Since agricultural systems exhibit substantial\\nvariability in terms of crop type, cultivar, management, seasonal growth\\ndynamics, lighting condition, sensor type, etc, a model trained from one\\ndataset often does not generalize well across domains. To enable more\\ndata efficient and generalizable neural network models in agriculture,\\nwe propose a method that generates photorealistic agricultural images\\nfrom a synthetic 3D crop model domain into real world crop domains.

Large area accurate mapping of soybean has long\\nbeen a vital, but challenging issue in remote sensing, relying heavily\\non large-volume and representative training samples, whose collection is\\ntime-consuming and inefficient, especially for large areas (e.g.,\\nnational scale). Thus, methods are needed that can map soybean\\nautomatically and accurately from single-date remotely sensed imagery.\\nIn this research, a novel Greenness and Water Content Composite Index\\n(GWCCI) was proposed to map soybean from just a single Sentinel-2\\nmultispectral image in an end-to-end manner without employing training\\nsamples. By capitalizing on the product of the NDVI (related to\\ngreenness) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band (related to canopy\\nwater content), the GWCCI provides the required information with which\\nto discriminate between soybean and other land cover types.

              "  'In recent years, methods based on deep convolutional neural networks\\n(CNNs) have dominated the classification task of hyperspectral images.\\nAlthough CNN-based HSI classification methods have the advantages of\\nspatial feature extraction, HSI images are characterized by\\napproximately continuous spectral information, usually containing\\nhundreds of spectral bands. CNN cannot mine and represent the sequence\\nproperties of spectral features well, and the transformer model of\\nattention mechanism proves its advantages in processing sequence data.\\nThis study proposes a new spectral spatial kernel combined with the\\nimproved Vision Transformer (ViT) to jointly extract spatial spectral\\nfeatures to complete classification task. First, the hyperspectral data\\nare dimensionally reduced by PCA; then, the shallow features are\\nextracted with an spectral spatial kernel, and the extracted features\\nare input into the improved ViT model. The improved ViT introduces a\\nre-attention mechanism and a local mechanism based on the original ViT.\\nThe re-attention mechanism can increase the diversity of attention maps\\nat different levels. The local mechanism is introduced into ViT to make\\nfull use of the local and global information of the data to improve the\\nclassification accuracy. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is used to\\nobtain the classification result. Among them, the Focal Loss function is\\nused to increase the loss weight of small-class samples and\\ndifficult-to-classify samples in HSI data samples and reduce the loss\\nweight of easy-to-classify samples, so that the network can learn more\\nuseful hyperspectral image information. In addition, using the Apollo\\noptimizer to train the HSI classification model to better update and\\ncompute network parameters that affect model training and model output,\\nthereby minimizing the loss function. We evaluated the classification\\nperformance of the proposed method on four different datasets, and\\nachieved good classification results on urban land object\\nclassification, crop classification and mineral classification,\\nrespectively.

In\\nMorocco, these traditional systems extend largely along the High Atlas\\nMountains. Yet, changing conditions in the Mediterranean basin as well\\nas recurrent droughts in recent decades remain poorly understood in\\nterms of hydrological and agricultural impacts, particularly in\\ntraditional hydro-agro-systems. The combined effects of climate\\nvariability and ineffective management of water resource dynamics may\\nlead to increased water scarcity in these regions. The present work aims\\nto assess the effects of climate variability and associated agricultural\\nchanges on water resources in a traditional irrigated piedmont of the\\nMoroccan High Atlas. To that end, a trend analysis, together with change\\npoints detection, was carried out on annual and monthly precipitation,\\nand streamflow from 1965 to 2018. Then, the standardized precipitation\\nindex (SPI) was employed to identify meteorological droughts. Also,\\ngroundwater, and spring discharge data were analyzed and discussed from\\n1973 to 2021. SPI outcomes revealed three major droughts, in 1981-1988,\\n1999-2008, and 2013-2018. Although the precipitation data showed no\\nsignificant trend, except for Tahannaout station, the average annual\\nprecipitation over the piedmont area decreased by 28\\\\%. Similarly,\\nstreamflow decreased significantly by almost 40\\\\% for all stations, as\\ndid the Abainou spring's discharge. Consistent with that, groundwater\\nlevel has declined dramatically over the past decades in the downstream\\npiedmont. These decreases in water cycle components were tightly aligned\\nwith droughts. Yet, irrigation diversions were maintained in both dry\\nand wet periods. Paradoxically, this decrease in water resources was\\nassociated with an agricultural transition from seasonal crops (cereals)\\nto perennial crops (olive trees). This conversion is likely to amplify\\nthe water shortage, leading to groundwater resources overexploitation to\\nsatisfy the growing agricultural demand.\"],\n",

Accurate remote sensing extraction of\\ncorn can realize the rational application of land resources, which is of\\ngreat significance to the sustainable development of modern agriculture.\\nIn the field of large-scale crop remote sensing classification,\\nsingle-period optical remote sensing images often cannot achieve\\nhigh-precision classification. To improve classification accuracy,\\nmultiple time series image combinations have gradually been adopted.\\nHowever, due to the influence of cloudy and rainy weather, it is often\\ndifficult to obtain complete time series optical images. Synthetic\\naperture radar (SAR) data are imaged by microwaves, which have strong\\npenetrating power and are not affected by clouds. A critical way to\\nsolve this problem is to use SAR images to compensate for the lack of\\noptical images and obtain a complete time series image in the\\ncorn-growing season. However, SAR images have limited wavelengths and\\ncannot provide important wavelengths, such as visible light bands and\\nnear-infrared information. To solve this problem, this study took\\nZhaodong City, a vital corn-planting base in China, as the research\\narea; took GF-6/GF-3 and Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 as remote sensing data\\nsources; designed12 classification scenarios; analyzed the best\\nclassification period and the best time series combination of corn\\nclassification; studied the influence of SAR images on the\\nclassification results of time series images; and compared the\\nclassification differences between GF-6/GF-3 and Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2.\\nThe results show that the classification accuracy of time series\\ncombinations is much higher than that of single-period images.

It is a beneficial\\nexploration of making use of existing parcel data generated by the\\nground survey and medium-resolution remote sensing images with suitable\\ntime and spatial resolution to extract winter wheat planting areas for\\nlarge-scale precision agricultural subsidies. Therefore, this paper\\nproposes a new algorithm to extract winter wheat planting areas based on\\nownership parcel data and medium-resolution remote sensing images for\\nimproving classification accuracy.

Here, an object- and\\ntopology-based analysis (OTBA) method, which considers spectral-spatial\\nfeatures and the topological relationship between paddy fields and their\\nenclosed ditches, was proposed to identify RCFs. First, we employed an\\nobject-based method to extract crayfish breeding ditches using very\\nhigh-resolution images. Subsequently, the paddy fields that provide\\nfodder for crayfish were identified according to the topological\\nrelationship between the paddy field and circumjacent crayfish ditch.\\nThe extracted ditch objects together with those paddy fields were merged\\nto derive the final RCFs. The performance of the OTBA method was\\ncarefully evaluated using the RCF and non-RCF samples. Moreover, the\\neffects of different spatial resolutions, spectral bands and temporal\\ninformation on RCF identification were comprehensively investigated. Our\\nresults suggest the OTBA method performed well in extracting RCFs, with\\nan overall accuracy of 91.77\\\\%. Although the mapping accuracies\\ndecreased as the image spatial resolution decreased, satisfactory RCF\\nmapping results (> 80\\\\%) can be achieved at spatial resolutions greater\\nthan 2 m.

This study therefore\\ninvestigates the direct relationship between satellite data from six\\ndifferent optical sensors as well as different soil and relief\\nparameters and yield data from cereal and canola recorded by the\\nthresher in the field. A time series of 13 years is considered, with 947\\nyield data sets consisting of dense point data sets and 755 satellite\\nimages. To answer the question of how well the relationship between\\nremote sensing data and yield is, the correlation coefficient r per\\nfield is calculated and interpreted in terms of crop type, phenology,\\nand sensor characteristics. The correlation value r is particularly high\\nwhen a field and its crop are spatially heterogeneous and when the\\ncorrect phenological time of the crop is reached at the time of\\nsatellite imaging. Satellite images with higher resolution, such as\\nRapidEye and Sentinel-2 performed better in comparison with lower\\nresolution sensors of the Landsat series.

The present study is applicable to\\nagricultural practices in many parts of the world that are in a\\ntemperate climate zone. The study area primarily uses centre-pivot\\nsystems supplied by wells. Water samples were taken periodically from\\nwells close to centre-pivot irrigation systems. Knowledge of isotope\\nratios in precipitation, the primary source of groundwater recharge is a\\nprerequisite for this study. The distribution of oxygen and hydrogen in\\nlocal precipitation, the so-called Local Meteoric Water Line, is\\navailable based on several years of measurements. An evaporative model\\nof the isotope data indicates water loss from evaporation to be in the\\nrange of 14\\\\% and 6\\\\%. This is less than what was estimated for arid\\nregion zones and is perhaps also due to the well-drained nature of the\\nregional soil which promotes rapid infiltration lowering evaporation.\\nEvaporative loss was greater at wells near cornfields than at wells that\\nsupplied other crop types. Little expected correlation between the\\ngroundwater isotope data and chloride concentration is attributable to\\nan external input of chloride from road salt used in winter months.'],\n",

The results\\nshowed that film-mulching drip irrigation (FMDI) increased CY and WUE by\\nabout 20\\\\% and 30\\\\%, respectively, compared with nonmulching drip\\nirrigation (NMDI). These improvements were affected by climatic\\nconditions (climate), soil conditions (SC), crop type (CT), water\\nconsumption (WC), and mulching material (MM).

To address these\\nissues, we develop a method to granulate the effective use interval of\\nclassification features by extracting phenological signatures of rice to\\nobtain cost-effective and highly accurate mapping results.

This study aims to\\nevaluate the utility of Sentinel-2 (S2) time series in accurately\\nmapping saffron fields and their ages (i.e., how many years saffron was\\ncultivated in a field), based on its unique phenology. To separate\\nsaffron from other land covers, we first derived 252 spectral-temporal\\nfeatures by calculating 21 spectral features (10 individual bands plus\\n11 vegetation indices) for each of the 12 months. A Random Forest (RF)\\nalgorithm was then used in combination with field data to retain only\\nfeatures of high importance for saffron classification. These features\\ncomprised vegetation indices that incorporated spectral information from\\nred, and near-and shortwave infrared bands during the phenological\\nphases of the rapid green up (February to March) and the dormant period\\n(August to October). The RF classifier resulted in a saffron map for the\\nyear 2019 with a high classification accuracy based on these features.\\nCompared against an independent in-situ saffron field dataset, 87.6\\\\% of\\nthe existing fields were correctly classified as saffron.

Using a spatially explicit design and intensive\\nsoil sampling strategy under three fertilization treatments in\\nswitchgrass (SG: Panicum virgatum L.) and gamagrass (GG: Tripsacum\\ndactyloides L.) croplands, we quantified the activities of polyphenolic\\noxidase (PHO), peroxidase (PER), and their sum associated with\\nrecalcitrant C acquisition (OX). The fertilization treatments included\\nno N fertilizer input (NN), low N input (LN: 84 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in\\nurea), and high N input (HN: 168 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in urea). Besides\\ncorrelations between soil oxidases and SOC (formerly published), both\\ndescriptive and geostatistical approaches were applied to evaluate the\\neffects of N fertilization and crop type on soil oxidases activities and\\ntheir spatial distributions. Results showed significantly negative\\ncorrelations between soil oxidase activities and SOC across all\\ntreatments. The negative relationship of soil oxidases and SOC was also\\nevident under N fertilization. First, LN significantly depressed\\noxidases in both mean activities and spatial heterogeneity, which\\ncorresponded to increased SOC in SG (though by 5.4\\\\%).

We found that the degree\\ndistribution (number of partners per species in the network) fitted\\nbetter to Fisher's log-series rather than Power law. Strong differences\\nbetween crops were observed in nestedness and specialisation, even when\\naccounting for the effect of sample size: in oilseed rape, networks were\\nmuch more nested and much less specialised than in sunflower. In\\naddition, the link `honeybee-crop flower' differed between the two\\nmass-flowering crops. Honeybees and sunflowers appeared as specialist\\nspecies in sunflower crops, interacting strongly and almost exclusively\\nwith each other, whereas they are usually considered highly generalist\\nspecies. Indeed, sunflower pollination may be almost entirely driven by\\nhoneybees, conversely to oilseed rape crops, where the presence of wild\\nbees and other insects tended to produce a more diversified network.\"],\n",

The metric allows us to identify optimal design parameters\\nincluding the spatial PV array density, panel orientation, and single\\naxis tracking schemes specific to the photosynthetically active\\nradiation needs of the crop. By definition, LPF equals 1 for PV-only or\\ncrop-only systems. The AV systems enhances LPF between 1 and 2 depending\\non the shade sensitivity of the crop, PV array configuration, and the\\nseason. While traditional fixed-tilt systems increase LPF significantly\\nabove 1, we find LPF is maximized at 2 for shade-tolerant crops with a\\nsolar farm based on single axis sun tracking scheme. Among the fixed\\ntilt systems, east/west faced bifacial vertical solar farms is\\nparticularly promising because it produces smallest variability in the\\nseasonal yield for shade sensitive crops, while providing LPF comparable\\nto the standard N/S faced solar farms. Additional benefits include\\nreduced soiling and ease of movement of large-scale combine-harvester\\nand other farming equipment.'],\n",

To increase\\nthe use efficiency and achieve more sustainable and environmentally\\nfriendly use of pesticides in China, it is crucial to understand why\\nChinese farmers use such a large amount of pesticides.\\nDesign/methodology/approach The relationship between farm size and\\npesticide use was investigated by using national household-level panel\\ndata from 1995 to 2016. Finding Farms that are small and fragmented lead\\nto the use of large amounts of pesticides in China. For a given crop\\ntype, three factors contribute to a negative relationship between farm\\nsize and pesticide use: the spillover effect from the use of pesticides\\nby other farmers in the same village, the level of mechanization and the\\nmanagement ability of farmers. The first two factors play important\\nroles in the cultivation of grain crops, while the last factor is the\\nmain reason why farmers with larger plots of land use fewer pesticides\\nin the cultivation of vegetables. In addition, the effect of\\nagricultural machinery services on reducing the use of pesticides is\\ncurrently limited, and the service system in China is still\\ninsufficient, which has been pointed out that it is also due to the\\nprevalence of small and fragmented farms.

Typical tillage of\\nautonomous tractors requires the tilled soil region detection to provide\\nthe local paths, which are usually determined based on the boundaries\\nbetween tilled and non-tilled soil. However, tilled soil regions usually\\nexhibit different feature distributions by field (domain) in terms of\\nfactors like soil characteristics, crop type, and method of tillage.\\nThis makes the development of deep learning-based systems with highly\\ngeneralizable performance difficult. In this study, this issue is\\naddressed by proposing a few-shot learning (FSL)-based effective tilled\\nsoil region segmentation, which is utilized to detect tilled soil region\\nin 2D perspective scenes to provide tillage path guidance to autonomous\\ntractors. The proposed approach used an image patch classification-based\\nfield region segmentation pipeline as the backbone and a one-shot\\nclassification model was designed to classify each image patch as tilled\\nor non-tilled soil. The tilled soil region is then segmented by\\nclustering the image patches belonging to the corresponding classes.

Explanatory\\nvariables related to site-specific environmental conditions and\\nmanagement practices were collected to identify and prioritize\\ncontributing factors that affect SOC stocks with cover crops, by\\ncoupling the Boruta algorithm and structural equation modeling. Overall,\\ncover crops significantly (P < 0.05) improved several indicators of soil\\nhealth, including greater SOC (concentration: +8\\\\%; stock: +7\\\\%), total\\nnitrogen (+8\\\\%), waterstable aggregates (+15\\\\%), and potential carbon\\nmineralization (+34\\\\%), on average, compared to no cover crop control.\\nLikewise, on average, cover crops sequestered SOC 3.55 Mg C ha-1 (0-15\\ncm depth), with a sequestration rate of 0.24 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. In\\naddition, we found climate (Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit) was\\nimportant in explaining the variation of SOC stocks with cover crops,\\nfollowed by soil properties (e.g., soil clay content). In terms of\\nmanagement practices, cover crop type had a significant positive (0.36)\\neffect on SOC stocks, with non-legumes showing a greater impact,\\ncompared to legumes and mixtures. Crop rotational diversity also had a\\npositive (0.28) effect on SOC accumulation.

              "  'The lack of suitable nesting sites is one key driver behind the farmland\\nbird crisis in Europe. Winter cereals become impenetrable for\\nground-breeding birds like the Eurasian Skylark (Alauda arvensis),\\ncurtailing breeding time. Stable Skylark populations depend on multiple\\nbreeding attempts per year; thus, the widespread cultivation of winter\\ncereals has strongly contributed to their tremendous decline. Crop\\ndiversification is thought to be a potential measure to counteract this\\ndevelopment. Therefore, we explored how individual Skylarks respond to\\nthe decreasing suitability of winter cereals as nesting habitats in\\nheterogeneous but otherwise conventionally managed farmland. Our study\\nfocused on: (i) the degree to which Skylarks prematurely cease nesting\\nactivity, switch nesting habitats, or breed on linear structures like\\ntramlines. Additionally, we analyzed: (ii) if nest success decreases\\nthroughout the breeding season and (iii) how often Skylarks make a\\nsuccessful breeding attempt per year. We radio-tagged 28 adults in a\\nGerman population during April 2018 and 2019, tracked half of them for\\nmore than 3 months, and measured their breeding success. Additionally,\\nwe monitored nests of untagged pairs, resulting in 96 nests found. None,\\nexcept one tagged individual, stopped breeding activity before July 1st.\\nHome ranges were mainly stable, but Skylarks switched nesting habitats\\naway from winter cereals to crops like sugar beet or set-aside.\\nHigh-risk nesting sites like corn and linear structures played a minor\\nrole in breeding. Overall, Mayfield logistic regressions revealed no\\nseasonal decrease in nest success, and tagged Skylarks had sufficient\\ntime to make 1.5-1.8 breeding attempts, of which 0.8 were successful. We\\nsuggest that heterogeneous farmland in our study area, which enabled\\ndiversely composed home ranges, prevented a curtailment of the breeding\\nseason. Thus, our study reinforces the need for crop diversification\\nwhich gives Skylarks a chance to survive in modern farmland.'],\n",

Unfortunately, acquiring high-spatial-resolution images of the\\nkey phenological period from a single satellite platform remains\\nchallenging due to its short duration and synchronization with the rainy\\nseason. Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is an effective tool for the\\nprediction of missing high spatial resolution images on the required\\ndate, however, most STF methods assume a uniform relationship between\\nthe reflectance on the base date and the predicted date for the same\\nland-cover type, which fails to hold in agricultural scenarios because\\nof the diverse phenological changes among different crop types or\\ndifferent growth processes, even within a single crop type. To address\\nthese challenges, we propose a novel spatiotemporal fusion method for\\nagricultural scenarios called Agri-Fuse. Agri-Fuse emphasizes change\\ninformation and classifies change types based on the difference image\\nderived from the fine image on the base date and the coarse image on the\\npredicted date. Considering the various regression relationships between\\nreflectance on the base date and the predicted date for different change\\ntypes, a category-based linear regression model was built, and we\\nintroduced an unmixing model to solve these regression coefficients.

To address this research gap, a\\nmeta-analysis with data from two experimental approaches (intercropping\\nand artificial shading with cloths, nets or solar panels) was performed.\\nThe aim was to quantitatively assess the susceptibility of different\\ntemperate crop types to increasing levels of shading. Crop type specific\\nyield response curves were developed as a function of reduction in solar\\nradiation, estimating relative crop yields compared to the unshaded\\ncontrols. Only studies that reported reduction in solar radiation and\\ncrop yield per area in temperate and subtropical areas were included.\\nThe results suggested a nonlinear relationship between achieved crop\\nyields and reduction in solar radiation for all crop types. Most crops\\ntolerate reduced solar radiation up to 15\\\\%, showing a less than\\nproportional yield decline. However, significant differences between the\\nresponse curves of the following crop types existed: Berries, fruits and\\nfruity vegetables benefited from reduction in solar radiation up to\\n30\\\\%. Forages, leafy vegetables, tubers/root crops, and C-3 cereals\\ninitially showed less than proportional crop yield loss. In contrast,\\nmaize and grain legumes experienced strong crop yield losses even at low\\nshade levels. The results provide a set of initial indicators that may\\nbe used in assessing the suitability of crop types for shade systems,\\nand thus for agrivoltaic or other dual land-use systems.

Many fertilizers recommendation systems are proposed\\nwithout considering the real-time context in terms of soil fertility\\nlevel, crop type, and soil type. The major obstacle in developing the\\nreal-time context-aware fertilizer recommendation system is related to\\nthe complexity associated with the real-time mapping of soil fertility.\\nFurthermore, the existing methods of determining the real-time soil\\nfertility levels for the recommendation of fertilizer are costly,\\ntimeconsuming, and laborious. Therefore, to tackle this issue, we\\npropose a machine learning-based fertilizer recommendation methodology\\naccording to the real-time soil fertility context captured through the\\nInternet of Things (IoT) assisted soil fertility mapping to improve the\\naccuracy of the fertilizer recommendation system. For real-time soil\\nfertility mapping, an IoT architecture is also proposed to support\\ncontext-aware fertilizer recommendations. The proposed solution is\\npractically implemented in real crop fields to assess the accuracies of\\nIoT-assisted fertility mapping. The accuracy of IoT-assisted fertility\\nmapping is assessed by comparing the proposed solution with the standard\\nsoil chemical analysis method in terms of observing Nitrogen (N),\\nPhosphorous (P), and Potassium (K). The results reveal that the\\nobservations by both methods are in line with a mean difference of 0.34,\\n0.36, and -0.13 for N, P, and K observations, respectively. The\\ncontext-aware fertilizer recommendation is implemented with the Logistic\\nRegression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes\\n(GNB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) machine learning models to assess\\nthe performance of these machine learning models.

The\\ngreatest inhibition of proliferation is observed for biodynamic\\ncultivation compared to organic cultivation, while the highest levels of\\napoptosis and necrosis of HT-29 cells are induced by blueberry fruit\\nextracts obtained from organic cultivation. The complementary effect of\\nthe extracts on the inhibition of HT-29 cell proliferation by anticancer\\ndrugs (5-FU and Erbitux) is not demonstrated. The induction of apoptosis\\nby 5-FU is not enhanced by blueberry extracts, in contrast to necrosis.\\nThe level of apoptosis and necrosis induced by Erbitux is potentiated,\\nbut no dependence on crop type is shown. Blueberry fruit extracts from\\ntwo consecutive years of cultivation did not maintain the same activity.\\nA plausible reason for the variability in the composition and biological\\nactivity of fruit extracts obtained from two years of cultivation is the\\nvarying environmental conditions.'],\n",

Moreover,\\nprevious studies only focused on the plant count of a single crop type.\\nTherefore, this study developed a method to fast and non-destructively\\ncount plant numbers using high-resolution UAV images. A computer\\nvision-based peak detection algorithm was applied to locate the crop\\nrows and plant seedlings. To test the method's robustness, it was used\\nto estimate the plant count of two different crop types (maize and\\nsunflower), in three different regions, at two different growth stages,\\nand on images with various resolutions. Maize and sunflower were chosen\\nto represent equidistant crops with distinct leaf shapes and\\nmorphological characteristics. For the maize dataset (with different\\nregions and growth stages), the proposed method attained R-2 of 0.76 and\\nrelative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 4.44\\\\%.

Linear regression showed an increase in flow\\nand sediment yield proportional to increases in arable crop area (p <\\n0.001). The spatial arrangement of cropped fields and riparian buffer\\nstrips produced no significant differences in event flow or sediment\\nyield (p > 0.05). However, buffer strip scenarios compared with the base\\nrun showed sediment load reductions for specific events, up to 20\\\\% and\\n15\\\\% for woodland and grass riparian buffers, respectively.

The IEDM is a decision tree model initially developed to\\ndetect irrigation events using the change detection algorithm applied to\\nthe S1 time series data. For each study site and at each agricultural\\nplot, all available S1 images during the period of irrigation were used\\nto construct an S1 time series and apply the IEDM. Different types of\\nmajor summer irrigated crops were analyzed in this study, including\\nMaize, Soybean, Sorghum and Potato, mainly with the sprinkler irrigation\\ntechnique. The irrigation detection accuracy was evaluated using S1\\nimages and the IEDM against the climatic condition of the studied area,\\nthe vegetation development (by means of the normalized difference\\nvegetation index, NDVI) and the revisit time of the S1 sensor. The main\\nresults showed generally good overall accuracy for irrigation detection\\nusing the S1 data, reaching 67\\\\% for all studied sites together. This\\naccuracy varied according to the climatic conditions of the studied\\narea, with the highest accuracy for semi-arid areas and lowest for\\ntemperate areas. The analysis of the irrigation detection as a function\\nof the crop type showed that the accuracy of irrigation detection\\ndecreases as the vegetation becomes well developed.

One proposal for addressing\\nthis challenge is to increase biodiversity in such landscapes by\\nincreasing crop diversity. However, studies report both positive and\\nnegative effects of crop diversity on biodiversity. One possible\\nexplanation, derived from the ``area-heterogeneity tradeoff hypothesis,\\n`` is that the effect of crop diversity on biodiversity depends on a\\ntradeoff between increasing the number of crop types in a landscape and\\ndecreasing the amount of each single crop type. This should cause\\npositive effects of increasing crop diversity at low to intermediate\\ncrop diversity and negative effects at intermediate to high crop\\ndiversity. We also propose two factors that could change the point at\\nwhich the effect of increasing crop diversity shifts from positive to\\nnegative. First, we predicted that this shift would occur at a lower\\ncrop diversity when the surrounding landscape contains less semi-natural\\nhabitat and at a higher crop diversity when the landscape contains more\\nsemi-natural habitat. This should increase the likelihood of detecting\\nnegative effects of crop diversity when semi-natural cover is low and\\npositive effects when it is high. Second, we predicted that the shift\\nfrom a positive to negative effect would occur at a lower crop diversity\\nwhen it is measured locally than when it is measured at greater\\ndistances from the site, making detection of negative crop diversity\\neffects more likely when measurements are at local extents.

Until the current study, there have been\\nno data or analyses showing these relationships in cultivated lands. We\\nexamined a fine line between two types of disturbance (i.e., cropland,\\noil \\\\& gas reclaimed cropland) and the invertebrates that could tolerate\\nthese disturbed conditions. We aimed to determine 1) if crop type, age\\nclass, reclamation criteria, soil type, disturbance history (reclaimed\\nwellsite) or a combination of these factors, influenced invertebrate\\nabundance; 2) if invertebrate community abundance correlated with soil\\nphysico-chemical properties or with the presence of major mesofauna\\ntaxa, and 3) if reclamation efforts, plus the additional yearly\\ncultivation activities, ameliorate the biological effects of oil and gas\\ndisturbance. Although we identified a clear trend in the densities and\\nabundances of major mesofauna taxa, they did not differ significantly\\nbetween groups. Reclaimed sites appeared more susceptible to crop pests\\n(Psocoptera and Hemiptera), especially on younger sites, which could\\nhave been driven by higher bulk density (low aeration). There were clear\\ndifferences in soil physico-chemical properties bulk density, pH, and\\ntotal organic carbon (TOC), which were not reflected in the\\nAcari:Collembola (A:C) ratios, invertebrate density or community\\nresults. There were some correlations between physico-chemical\\nproperties and specific invertebrate groups. Oribatida were positively\\ncorrelated with electrical conductivity; Astigmata, Oribatida, and\\nSymphyla were negatively correlated with bulk density; Prostigmata,\\nCollembola, and Mesostigmata were negatively correlated with pH, and\\nMesostigmata were positively correlated with TOC. The site age results\\nindicate that cultivation activities may reset mesofauna community\\nsuccession each year, creating densities and abundances similar to that\\nof adjacent cultivated fields and masking long-term industrial effects.\\nFor these reasons, neither broad invertebrate taxa nor A:C ratios should\\nbe used as indicators of reclamation quality or biological recovery on\\nindustrially reclaimed, cultivated sites if the comparable references\\nare also cultivated.

This paper proposes a\\nGaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for the reconstruction of parcel-level\\nfeatures extracted from multispectral images. A robust version of the\\nGMM is also investigated, since datasets can be contaminated by\\ninaccurate samples or features (e.g., wrong crop type reported,\\ninaccurate boundaries, undetected clouds, etc). Additional features\\nextracted from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Sentinel-1\\ndata are also used to provide complementary information and improve the\\nimputations. The robust GMM investigated in this work assigns reduced\\nweights to the outliers during the estimation of the GMM parameters,\\nwhich improves the final reconstruction.

UAV images are quite trustworthy to identify different\\ncrops due to its higher spatial resolution. For precision agriculture\\ncrop identification is the primal criteria. Identifying a specific type\\nof crop in a land is essential for performing proper farming and that\\nalso helps to estimate the net yield production of a particular crop.\\nPrevious works are limited to identify a single crop from the RGB images\\ncaptured by UAVs and have not explored the chance of multi-crop\\nclassification by implementing deep learning techniques. Multi crop\\nidentification tool is highly needed as designing separate tool for each\\ntype of crop is a cumbersome job, but if a tool can successfully\\ndifferentiate multiple crops then that will be helpful for the agro\\nexperts. In contrast with the previous existing techniques, this article\\nelucidates a new conjugated dense CNN (CD-CNN) architecture with a new\\nactivation function named SL-ReLU for intelligent classification of\\nmultiple crops from RGB images captured by UAV. CD-CNN integrates data\\nfusion and feature map extraction in conjunction with classification\\nprocess. Initially a dense block architecture is proposed with a new\\nactivation function, called SL-ReLU, associated with the convolution\\noperation to mitigate the chance of unbounded convolved output and\\ngradient explosion. Dense block architecture concatenates all the\\nprevious layer features for determining the new features. This reduces\\nthe chance of losing important features due to deepening of the CNN\\nmodule. Later, two dense blocks are conjugated with the help of a\\nconversion block for obtaining better performance. Unlike traditional\\nCNN, CD-CNN omits the use of fully connected layer and that reduces the\\nchance of feature loss due to random weight initialization.

The groundwater table\\ndepth in the crop growing season had the least impact on the change in\\nroot zone soil salinity (p > 0.05). Interactions between crop types and\\ngroundwater table depth had a significant effect on the change of soil\\nsalinity in the root zone during the growing season of the dry year, but\\nwere insignificant during the wet year. Crop types, groundwater table\\ndepth, and climate conditions determined the contribution of shallow\\ngroundwater to crop water consumption and, to a greater extent, soil\\nsalinity. Regression tree analysis showed that groundwater salinity and\\nsoil texture had a greater influence on soil salinity than groundwater\\ntable depth and land elevation. The effect of groundwater on soil\\nsalinity is strongly related to soil texture, and the salinity of\\nfine-textured soil was 36-54\\\\% greater than that of coarse-textured soil\\ndue to large capillary action.

In contrast,\\nonly one farmer CS (3year rotation, low tillage intensity, intermediate\\nherbicide reliance) showed significantly higher levels of weed\\ndiversity, possibly because the reduced tillage intensity was not\\ncompensated by other agronomic levers (e.g. increase of herbicide use\\nand/or crop rotation diversity). Such outcomes were attributed to (i)\\nreduced CS complexity in commercial compared to experimental farms and\\n(ii) high herbicide reliance in commercial farms, irrespectively of CS\\ncomplexity. Across both experimental and commercial farms, tillage, weed\\nmanagement and crop type appeared as the main factors structuring weed\\ncommunities.

Interseeding cover crops into a standing cash crop can\\nimprove establishment before winter, but its practice is limited in both\\nscope and scale. OBJECTIVE: To identify tradeoffs and establish regional\\npatterns of interseeding success in the environmentally sensitive\\nChesapeake Bay Watershed of North America, we used the agroecosystem\\nmodel Cycles to compare in silico systems in which cover crops were\\neither interseeded into a standing crop of corn (Zea mays L.) or\\nconventionally seeded after corn harvest. METHODS: In each of the 153\\ncounties contained in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, a representative\\nfield was simulated and either seeded with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.),\\na blend of legumes, or a mix of legumes and ryegrass in a continuous\\ncorn sequence. The simulated corn yield, cover crop biomass production,\\nN leaching reduction, and total N losses were compared between the cover\\ncrop scenarios and a monoculture corn control. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:\\nSimulations showed that conventionally seeded cover crops did not affect\\ncorn yields of the following year. However, when interseeded, the drag\\non corn yield in the same year averaged 6\\\\% per Mg of fall cover crop\\nbiomass. The corn yield reduction notwithstanding, interseeding reduced\\nN leaching by 10\\\\% for legumes, 25\\\\% for the mix, and 50\\\\% for solo\\nryegrass compared to the no cover-crop control. There are other\\ntradeoffs, such as an offset of N fertilizer inputs from N2 fixation\\nwhen using legumes despite the less effective nutrient capture.\\nRegardless of the cover crop type, interseeding up to latitude 41\\ndegrees N tends to be competitive with the cash crop, but north of that\\nthreshold (or west into higher elevations) the mitigation of N leaching\\nwhen interseeding seems to outweigh agronomic costs.

Given these analyses, future field\\nresearch in areas suitable for interseeding can focus on establishing\\nlegume cover crops in high-yielding fields with low residual mineral N,\\ngrass cover crops in manured or low-yielding fields with residual\\nmineral N, and a mixture of both when N supply is uncertain and\\npreventive management is needed.'],\n",

However, there are still a lot\\nof uncertainties related to i) the combined effects of different crop\\nrotations and different fertilisation sources, e.g., organic amendments,\\non soil C stocks; and ii) their potential effect on C stabilisation. The\\nobjective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different arable\\ncrop rotations with varying degrees of diversity in crop type and\\nlengths of grass-clover ley periods and fertilisation sources on soil C\\nstocks and C stabilisation down to 0.60 m soil depth. This was\\ninvestigated in a long-term factorial field experiment-combining\\ndifferent crop rotation (cereal-intensive conventional vs. diversified\\nlegume-intensive organic) with different lengths of grass-clover ley\\nperiods (2 vs. 3 years), fertilisation sources (mineral vs. compost),\\nand years (samples taken at the beginning and at the last year of one\\ncomplete cycle of rotation; 8 years apart)-to explore their individual\\nand interactive effect on soil C stock and C stabilisation at two soil\\ndepths (0-0.30 and 0.30-0.60 m). Soil C stabilisation was assessed using\\na unique combination of three different techniques: physical\\nfractionation for separation of C associated to organic and mineral\\nfractions, thermal analysis combined with differential scanning\\ncalorimetry and a quadrupole mass spectrometry (TG-DSC-QMS) for\\nphysical-chemical aspects, and pyrolysis coupled with gas\\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) for molecular structural\\ninformation. The findings showed higher soil C stocks under the\\ndiversified organic rotation with 3 years of grass-clover ley period at\\nboth soil depths, regardless of the fertilisation source or sampling\\nyear. However, the organic rotation seemed to deliver stable soil C\\nstocks only in the subsoil layer. Compost fertilisation, in turn,\\nincreased topsoil C stocks between the two sample dates under both\\nrotations, and it appears to be stable. These results suggested that\\ncombining a diversified organic rotation with 3 years grass-clover ley\\nwith compost fertilisation could be one way for agricultural systems to\\ndeliver stable soil C sequestration.'],\n",

The results revealed decreased\\nrichness and diversity in microbial communities at increasing soil\\ndepth. Soil microbial community composition differed due to crop type\\nonly in the top 60cm and due to location only in the top 90 cm. While\\nthe relative abundance of most phyla decreased in deep soils, the\\nrelative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria increased and dominated\\nagricultural soils below the depth of 90 cm. Although soil depth was the\\nmost important factor shaping microbial communities, edaphic factors,\\nincluding soil organic matter, soil bulk density, and the length of time\\nthat deep soils were saturated with water, were all significant factors\\nexplaining the variation in soil microbial community composition. Soil\\norganic matter showed the highest correlation with the exponential\\ndecrease in bacterial abundance with depth. A greater understanding of\\nhow soil depth influences the diversity and composition of soil\\nmicrobial communities is vital for guiding sampling approaches in\\nagricultural soils where plant roots extend beyond the upper soil\\nprofile. In the long term, a greater knowledge of the influence of depth\\non microbial communities should contribute to new strategies that\\nenhance the sustainability of soil, which is a precious resource for\\nfood security.\\nIMPORTANCE Determining how microbial properties change across different\\nsoils and within the soil depth profile will be potentially beneficial\\nto understanding the long-term processes that are involved in the health\\nof agricultural ecosystems.

However, the existing efforts based on coarse\\nresolution data (\\\\& GE;500 m) cannot perform well in regions with higher\\nspatial heterogeneity and multi-cropping system, such as China. Given\\nthat the majority of 10 m/30 m-based phenological research has focused\\non North America and Europe, developing spatiotemporally explicit LSP\\ndata in China is imperative. More importantly, the existing 30 m LSP\\nproducts are mainly suitable for vegetation types with a single\\nvegetation cycle, but cannot work well for biomes with complex\\nseasonality (e.g., multiple growth cycles).

Available land is mapped based on land\\nmarginality and Renewable Energy Directive Recast (REDII) land-related\\nsustainability criteria. Biomass potentials are assessed with a\\nwater-use-to-biomass-production approach while considering the available\\nland, location-specific biophysical conditions and crop-specific\\nphenological characteristics. The GHG balance of advanced biofuels from\\nenergy crops produced on marginal lands is assessed considering both\\nland-related carbon stock changes and supply chain emissions with the\\ncarbon footprint approach from the REDII. Available marginal land that\\nmeets REDII criteria is projected at 20.5-21 Mha 2030 and 2050,\\nrespectively. Due to biophysical limitations, not all available land is\\nsuitable for energy crop production. The maximum biomass potential of\\nlignocellulosic energy crops (optimal crop choice with maximum yield for\\neach available location) varies between 1951 PJ year(-1) in 2030 and\\n2265 PJ year(-1) in 2050.

The skewed distribution of the number of\\nfarms and the agricultural area by farm size may explain overestimations\\nin small farms' food production. In fact, the highest values found in\\nliterature seem to be more strongly correlated to the total number of\\nsmall farms than to the actual area they cover, suggesting errors in the\\nestimation procedures. Additionally, a significant part of the small\\nfarms is not considered in official statistics, thus limiting the use of\\nthe data and also leading to underestimations. New efforts are thus\\nneeded to develop and apply methodologies to reduce the error and\\nuncertainty of these estimates. In this paper we demonstrate the\\nprogress obtained by using a novel approach to provide new and more\\naccurate estimates on the availability of food produced in small farms\\nin 17 European regions (NUTS-3 level) distributed in 8 countries. Our\\nassessment was carried out using two data sets: {[}1] data on crop area\\nand production for a priori selected key products in each reference\\nregion, collected through questionnaires to small producers; {[}2]\\nremote sensing-based products derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\\nimages, including crop type maps with ground-truth validation and\\nsmall-scale farming systems probability maps. To reduce error\\npropagation resulting from self-reported yield estimates, we used robust\\nmeasures of central tendency based on Tukey's bi-weight function to\\ncompute the overall production in small farms in each region, minimizing\\nthe effect of outliers. The self-reported yields by small farmers were\\nalso compared with national and regional values of productivity per unit\\narea and discussed in light of previous findings.

This study answers\\nthe following research questions. First, does the value of the\\nb-parameter value vary across the U.S. Corn Belt given the observed\\ndifferences in the proportions of corn and soybeans grown across the\\nregion? Secondly, does the SMAP b-parameter value vary throughout the\\ngrowing season given the significant change in the distribution of crop\\nwater within tissue types throughout the growing season? Since in-situ\\nmeasurements of the b-parameter are higher for corn, we hypothesize that\\nas the relative fraction of corn in a SMAP pixel increases, the\\nb-parameter will increase. We test this hypothesis using satellite scale\\nmodeling of crop water and SMAP L2 DCA VOD measurements at 18 sites\\nacross the U.S. Corn Belt for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. For each\\nsite year, the crop water for the satellite pixel is simulated using the\\nAgro-IBIS crop model and is weighted according to the proportion of corn\\nand soybeans grown in that location.

              "  'A correct estimation of crop coefficients (K-C) is essential to assess\\nwater requirements of crops from weather variables and thereby optimize\\nirrigation management. K-C depends on crop type and varies with crop\\ngrowth stage, and to a limited extent, with climate. K-C values are\\noften assumed to be transferable between locations and climates. K-C\\nvalues have not been determined yet for modern potato cultivars grown\\nunder South African, semi-arid climatic conditions. The objectives of\\nthis study were (i) to quantify evapotranspiration and water use\\nefficiency (WUE) of potato crops in a semi-arid climate under\\nirrigation, (ii) to estimate K-C values for these crops at different\\ngrowth stages, and (iii) to assess the usefulness of the Penman-Monteith\\nequation to estimate evapotranspiration and irrigation requirements. An\\neddy covariance (ECV) system was used in potato fields planted with the\\nvariety Mondial in two production regions of South Africa: Limpopo (crop\\ngrowing in winter) and North West (spring-summer crop). Additional\\nsensors were added to the system to measure relative humidity, near\\nsurface soil temperature, solar radiation, rainfall and irrigation.\\nDecagon 10 HS capacitance sensors installed at varying soil depths were\\nused to measure the change in soil moisture content of the potato rooted\\nzone. Accuracy of the ECV measurements was evaluated by following the\\nenergy balance closure method. Seasonal mean crop evapotranspiration\\n(ETC) was 3.2 mm d(-1) for the crop in Limpopo and 5.7 mm d(-1) in North\\nWest. The reference evapotranspiration (ETO) correlated well with the\\ndaily patterns in ETC for most of the season. ETO thus serves as a\\nuseful indicator of ETC and can be used for irrigation scheduling of\\npotato. Seasonal mean K-C value was 0.99 for the crop in Limpopo and\\n0.78 in North West. While the K-C value in Limpopo likely represented\\nthat for a crop free of water-stress, the crop growth in North West was\\nlikely somewhat limited by water availability. The winter crop had the\\nhighest WUE of 3.55 kg dry potato tuber m(-3) of water evapotranspired,\\nwhilst WUE for the spring-summer crop was 3.03 kg m(-3). This difference\\ncould be explained by differences in mean vapour pressure deficit\\nbetween the growing seasons. To optimize WUE of potato growing in\\nsemi-arid, water scarce regions such as South Africa, it is advisable to\\ngrow crops in the coolest available growing season, outside the\\nfrost-prone period.'],\n",

The analysis was performed using C-band time series\\ndata derived from the Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite and two L-band images\\nfrom the PALSAR-2 (ALOS-2) sensor acquired over irrigated grassland\\nplots in the Crau plain of southeast France. The S1 C-band time series\\nwas first analyzed as a function of rainfall and irrigation events. The\\nbackscattering coefficients in both the L and C bands were then compared\\nto the time difference between the date of the acquired SAR image and\\nthe date of the last irrigation event occurring before the SAR\\nacquisition (Delta t). Sensitivity analysis was performed for 2 classes\\nof the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI <= 0.7 and NDVI >\\n0.7). The main results showed that when the vegetation is moderately\\ndeveloped (NDVI <= 0.7), the C-band temporal variation remains sensitive\\nto the soil moisture dynamics and the irrigation events could be\\ndetected. The C-VV signal decreases due to the drying out of the soil\\nwhen the time difference between the S1 image and irrigation event\\nincreases. For well-developed vegetation cover (NDVI > 0.7), the C-band\\nsensitivity to irrigation events becomes dependent on the crop type. For\\nwell-developed Gramineae grass with longs stalks and seedheads, the C\\nband shows no correlation with Delta t due to the absence of the soil\\ncontribution in the backscattered signal, contrary to the legume grass\\ntype, where the C band shows a good correspondence between C-VV and\\nDelta t for NDVI > 0.7. In contrast, analysis of the L-band\\nbackscattering coefficient shows that the L band remains sensitive to\\nthe soil moisture regardless of the vegetation cover development and the\\nvegetation characteristics, thus being more suitable for irrigation\\ndetection than the C band. The L-HH signal over Gramineae grass or\\nlegume grass types shows the same decreasing pattern with the increase\\nin Delta t, regardless of the NDVI-values, presenting a decrease in soil\\nmoisture with time and thus high sensitivity of the radar signal to soil\\nparameters.

This commentary\\nseeks to place those and other recent findings about the modifications\\nto the plant micro-environment by PV cells in the context of maximum\\nattainable aboveground biomass.\\nPlain Language Summary With high demands for electricity and reduced\\ncosts of solar panel manufacturing, competition for arable land between\\nsolar energy production and crops comes as no surprise. A possible way\\nforward to ameliorate the adverse effects of such competition is a\\nsolution labeled as Agriphotovoltaics or simply Agrivoltaics (AV). AV is\\nthe simultaneous use of land area for photovoltaic (PV) power generation\\nand crop production. Crops are grown under elevated and fully opaque\\nsolar panels so that the degree of shade and transmissible wavelengths\\ncan be partly controlled. The premise of AV rests on the fact that\\nplants require light to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere so as\\nto produce biomass (including fruits, green leaves, roots, etc...). This\\nprocess, known as photosynthesis, exhibits a saturation behavior-meaning\\nbeyond some light level, increasing light does not enhance by much plant\\nuptake of carbon dioxide molecules from the atmosphere. In the process\\nof capturing one carbon dioxide molecule, plants also loose some 400\\nwater molecules from their leaves, a process labeled as transpiration,\\nthereby necessitating sustained water replenishment to the leaf from the\\nsoil. The theoretical premise of AV is that the ``excess light{''} not\\nused in photosynthesis may be used for energy production. Moreover, the\\nevaporative cooling offered by transpiration can enhance the efficiency\\nof solar panels to convert light to energy generation. Thus, the\\nchallenge to AV is how to utilize these principles for maximizing crop\\nproductivity, minimizing transpiration losses to reduce irrigation\\nneeds, and maximizing photovoltaic energy generation. A necessary first\\nstep to address this challenge requires the mathematical quantification\\nof how crops utilize the various wavelengths of light in photosynthesis\\nand, eventually, how these assimilated carbon dioxide molecules are\\nconverted to crop yield.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to\\nevaluate crop productivity (i.e., biomass, grain, total yield) and GHGs\\nemissions (i.e., CO2, N2O, CH4) for three major soil conservation\\npractices i.e., no-tillage, manures, and biochar. We also examined the\\nyield potential of three major cereal crops (i.e., wheat, rice, maize)\\nand their significance in mitigating GHGs emissions. None of the manures\\nwere able to reduce GHGs emissions, with poultry manure being the\\nlargest contributor to all GHGs emissions. However, pig-manure had the\\ngreatest impact on crop yield while emitting the least CO2 emissions.\\nUse of biochar showed a strong coupling effect between reduction of GHGs\\n(i.e., CH4 by -37\\\\%; N2O by -25\\\\%; CO2 by -5\\\\%) and the increase in crop\\nproductivity. In contrast, no-tillage resulted in higher GHGs emissions\\nwith only a marginal increase in grain yield. Depending on crop type,\\nall cereal crops showed varied degrees of GHGs mitigation under biochar\\napplication, with wheat responding most strongly due to the additional\\nyield increment. The addition of biochar significantly reduced CO2 and\\nN2O emissions under both rainfed and irrigated conditions, although CH4\\nreductions were identical in both agroecosystems. Interestingly, the use\\nof biochar resulted in a greater yield benefit in rainfed than in\\nirrigated agriculture. Despite significant GHGs emissions, manure\\napplication contributed to higher crop yields, regardless of soil type\\nor agroecosystem. Moreover, no-tillage showed a significant reduction in\\nCH4 and N2O emissions under rainfed and irrigated conditions.

The results showed that for the\\nmulti-classification (including tea plantations, forest, cropland,\\nimpervious and water body) the overall accuracy (OA)/ Kappa coefficient\\n(Kappa) are Bayes (87.73\\\\%/0.70), DT5.0 (91.23\\\\%/0.78) and RF\\n(88.52\\\\%/0.72) respectively, but for tea plantations, the producer\\naccuracy (PA)/user accuracy (UA) are Bayes (67.23\\\\%/75.33\\\\%), DT\\n(68.84\\\\%/83.83\\\\%) and RF (70.54\\\\%/87.13\\\\%). Compared with the\\nobject-oriented RF multi-classification, the OA and Kappa of the\\nobject-oriented RF binary classification (tea plantations and others)\\nincreased by 3.24\\\\% and 0.07, the PA/UA of tea plantations increased by\\n5.99\\\\%/5.61\\\\%. Similarly, compared with the pixel-based\\nmulti-classification, the OA and Kappa of the object-oriented RF binary\\nclassification increased by 23.32\\\\% and 0.27, the PA/UA of tea\\nplantations increased by 21.10\\\\%/29.03\\\\%, respectively. The results\\nindicated that the object-oriented supervised classification methods\\nhave the potential for tea plantations extraction, especially the\\nobject-oriented RF classification got a higher accuracy. Moreover, the\\nbinary classification method has higher accuracy than that of\\nmulti-classification for tea plantation extraction.

              "  \"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the lowest rate of electricity access and\\nirrigation in the world, at 45\\\\% and 5\\\\% respectively. The problem is in\\npart due to the low economic viability of rural electrification,\\nparticularly through grid extension, lack of low-cost irrigation energy,\\nand limited access to finance for the high cost of irrigation\\ninfrastructure. Despite their promising potential, minigrids' deployment\\nhas been rather slow in SSA, partly due to the lack of viable business\\nmodels for the dispersed low-income rural population. In this paper, we\\npresent an integrated model that couples a minigrid model with a crop\\nmodel to explore the nexus potential of joint deployment of minigrids\\nwith smallholder irrigation to alleviate barriers to both minigrid\\nscale-up and irrigation adoption. We apply the proposed model to three\\nrural case studies in different geographical contexts in SSA. Our\\nsimulation results show the potential of irrigation loads to lower the\\nunit cost of minigrid energy (LCOE) by up to 47\\\\%, depending on the\\nquantity of irrigable land and its spatial distribution. A further\\nscenario-based sensitivity analysis of the minigrid with and without\\naggregate irrigation load shows wide variations in LCOE-between a\\nminimum of \\\\$0.24/kWh and a maximum of \\\\$1.2/kWh-with changes in the\\ncost of capital and technology cost. Regarding irrigation viability, our\\nmodel results show that irrigation profitability is a function of a\\ncomplex interplay of factors, including crop type, soil fertility,\\ninfrastructure costs, energy prices, fertiliser application rate, and\\ncrop farm gate prices. We further test the effects of pay-as-you-go\\n(PAYGo) business model incentives on the profitability of irrigation\\nwith minigrids; our results show that various incentives that alleviate\\neither all or a fraction of upfront capital cost do not only mitigate\\nirrigation adoption barrier but also enhances its profitability on the\\npart of the farmer. Finally, our model results underscore that the\\neconomic viability of joint deployment of minigrids with smallholder\\nirrigation depends on the optimal combination of agro-ecological factors\\nof production (location suitability), type of crop (on a descending\\norder, onion, tomato, and potato are the most profitable crops in our\\nmodel), fertiliser application rate (near-optimal to optimal soil\\nfertility is recommended) and cost scenarios (low cost of capital and\\ntechnology preferred). In the main, our model and the results thereof\\nhighlight the potential benefits of co-planning minigrids and irrigation\\nprojects. Our model and results presented in this paper can be used as\\nhigh-level decision-making pointers on the nexus planning of minigrids\\nwith smallholder irrigation farming.\"],\n",

Studying the content and influencing\\nfactors of fluoride in soils is of great significance for the\\nmaintenance of regional eco-logical security and human health. This\\nstudy takes the farmland soils in the west of NLB as the research focus\\nand uses a method based on GIS and geostatistics to quantitatively\\nanalyze the spatial variation characteristics of soil total fluoride and\\nwater-soluble fluoride contents to draw a map showing their spatial\\ndistribution. The effects on the spatial distribution of soil total\\nfluoride and water-soluble fluoride were analyzed from the aspects of\\ngeomorphological type, soil parent material (stratigraphic lithology),\\ncrop type, and groundwater fluoride concentration, among others, and the\\ncorrelation between groundwater and soil fluoride contents was also\\nanalyzed. Our study results in the following findings: (1) The average\\ncontent of total fluoride in topsoil in the study area is 652.8 mg/kg,\\nthe national background value is exceeded in 99.5\\\\% of the sampling\\nsites, and the background value of Shandong Province is exceeded in\\n98.7\\\\% of the sampling sites. The average water-soluble fluoride is 15.2\\nmg/kg and exceeds 5.0 mg/kg in 94.3\\\\% of the sampling sites. Topsoils\\nhave high values of total fluoride and water-soluble fluoride. (2) The\\ntotal fluoride and water-soluble fluoride in topsoils exhibit moderate\\nspatial variability, indicating that their spatial distribution is the\\nresult of structural factors such as soil parent materials and man-made\\nrandom factors such as fluorinated fertilizers. (3) In the 2 m vertical\\nprofile of shallow soils, total fluoride and water-soluble fluoride\\nincrease with the increase in soil viscosity, and the water-soluble\\nfluoride has the characteristics of surface aggregation due to the\\ninfluence of soil adsorption. Because fluoride ions as ligands are\\neasily adsorbed and form fluoride complexes with other ions such as\\naluminum ions, the water-soluble fluoride shows the characteristics of\\nsurface aggregation and fractionation. (4) The analysis of influencing\\nfactors reveals that the lithology of Quaternary strata,\\ngeomorpho-logical types, and planting crop types have significant\\neffects on the distribution of the total fluoride and water-soluble\\nfluoride in the topsoils, and the distribution of the groundwater\\nsoluble fluoride in the topsoils is not related to that in groundwater.\\nOur study provides data and technical support for improving both the\\nsoil environmental quality and water quality of the eastern route of the\\nSouth-to-North Water Transfer Project, thus helping to promote the\\nsustainable development of the social economy and ecological environment\\nin the NLB.'],\n",

Regenerative agriculture is known across the world\\nas a combination of nature-friendly farming practices such as no-till,\\ncover cropping, crop-rotation, agroforestry and use of organic\\nhome-based/farm-based ingredients to revive soil health. In India, a\\nnumber of farmers are slowly adopting these practices using home-based\\nmixtures and farmyard manure for soil rejuvenation and pest management.\\nIn order to evaluate the efficacy of the regenerative agriculture\\npractices, this study compared conventional and regenerative agriculture\\nplots for their soil bacterial and nutrient profiles. MethodsTwo crops -\\nragi (Finger millet, an old world cereal eaten in India) and vegetable\\n(tomato/beans), and different lengths (<= 3 and >5 years) of\\nregenerative practices were additional metrics considered to understand\\nvariabilities due to crop-type and period of application. The common\\nregenerative agriculture practices used by farmers in this study\\nincluded a mix of practices such as mulching, minimal-till,\\ninter-cropping, crop-rotation, along with application of farmyard manure\\nand other home-based concoctions rich in nutrients and microbes for\\nenriching the soil. ResultsWe found that all regenerative practices were\\neffective in bringing about an enrichment for soil bacteria with a more\\nheterogeneous composition.

              "  'Background The superposition of COVID-19 and climate change has brought\\ngreat challenges to global food security. As a major economic crop in\\nthe world, studying its phenotype to cultivate high-quality wheat\\nvarieties is an important way to increase grain yield. However, most of\\nthe existing phenotyping platforms have the disadvantages of high\\nconstruction and maintenance costs, immobile and limited in use by\\nclimatic factors, while the traditional climate chambers lack phenotypic\\ndata acquisition, which makes crop phenotyping research and development\\ndifficult. Crop breeding progress is slow. At present, there is an\\nurgent need to develop a low-cost, easy-to-promote, climate- and\\nsite-independent facility that combines the functions of crop\\ncultivation and phenotype acquisition. We propose a movable cabin-type\\nintelligent artificial climate chamber, and build an environmental\\ncontrol system, a crop phenotype monitoring system, and a crop phenotype\\nacquisition system. Result We selected two wheat varieties with\\ndifferent early vigor to carry out the cultivation experiments and\\nphenotype acquisition of wheat under different nitrogen fertilizer\\napplication rates in an intelligent artificial climate chamber. With the\\nhelp of the crop phenotype acquisition system, images of wheat at the\\ntrefoil stage, pre-tillering stage, late tillering stage and jointing\\nstage were collected, and then the phenotypic information including\\nwheat leaf area, plant height, and canopy temperature were extracted by\\nthe crop type acquisition system. We compared systematic and manual\\nmeasurements of crop phenotypes for wheat phenotypes. The results of the\\nanalysis showed that the systematic measurements of leaf area, plant\\nheight and canopy temperature of wheat in four growth periods were\\nhighly correlated with the artificial measurements. The correlation\\ncoefficient (r) is positive, and the determination coefficient (R-2) is\\ngreater than 0.7156. The root mean square error (RSME) is less than\\n2.42. Among them, the crop phenotype-based collection system has the\\nsmallest measurement error for the phenotypic characteristics of wheat\\ntrefoil stage. The canopy temperature RSME is only 0.261. The systematic\\nmeasurement values of wheat phenotypic characteristics were\\nsignificantly positively correlated with the artificial measurement\\nvalues, the fitting degree was good, and the errors were all within the\\nacceptable range. The experiment showed that the phenotypic data\\nobtained with the intelligent artificial climate chamber has high\\naccuracy. We verified the feasibility of wheat cultivation and phenotype\\nacquisition based on intelligent artificial climate chamber. Conclusion\\nIt is feasible to study wheat cultivation and canopy phenotype with the\\nhelp of intelligent artificial climate chamber. Based on a variety of\\nenvironmental monitoring sensors and environmental regulation equipment,\\nthe growth environment factors of crops can be adjusted. Based on\\nhigh-precision mechanical transmission and multi-dimensional imaging\\nsensors, crop images can be collected to extract crop phenotype\\ninformation. Its use is not limited by environmental and climatic\\nfactors.

Moreover, Olsen-P contents in\\nsoil were determined to evaluate if crop yields and P balances were\\nreflected in measures of available P. Methods: On a coarse sandy soil\\ninstalled in lysimeters under field conditions, crop yields and P\\nsurpluses from 1992 to 2022 were quantified as affected by P fertilizer\\nsource (annual additions of solid pig manure, pig slurry and mineral\\nfertilizer) since 1975. All lysimeters received mineral nitrogen (N)\\nfertilizers according to the crop demand. Olsen-P contents in the upper\\nsoil layer (0-25 cm) were measured over three decades, and vertical\\ndistribution of P in soil down to 140 cm depth was studied at the end of\\nthe experimental period.Results: For oats, barley, pea and beet root,\\nlong-term fertilization with solid pig manure at a rate of 15 kg P\\nha(-1) year(-1) resulted in similar yields as after fertilization with\\n30 kg mineral P ha(-1) year(-1). After 30 years, the build-up of P in\\nsoil was much lower after solid pig manure inputs (accumulation of 8 kg\\nP ha(-1)) than after mineral P fertilization (accumulation of 51 and 434\\nkg P ha(-1) in soil receiving 15 and 30 kg mineral P ha(-1) year(-1),\\nrespectively). The long-term fertilizer treatments affected Olsen-P\\nlevels in the upper soil layer with highest Olsen-P contents (>40 mg P\\nkg(-1)) after fertilization with 30 kg mineral P ha(-1) year-1. Only\\nmaize benefitted from high Olsen-P levels and generous input of mineral\\nP, whereas the yield potential for the other crop types could be reached\\nat low to moderate Olsen-P levels after long-term additions of solid pig\\nmanure. More P was found in the deep soil layers (65-140 cm) after\\naddition of pig slurry than solid pig manure. Conclusions: The results\\nshowed that solid pig manure was a valuable P source that had the\\npotential to replace mineral P fertilizers without compromising crop\\nproductivity, while ensuring low P surpluses.

              "  \"Simple Summary\\nIn grain crops, aphids are important pests, but they can be suppressed\\nby parasitoid wasps that use them as hosts for their developing\\noffspring. These wasps occur naturally in the environment and can be\\nutilized in the control of these pests. We investigated how the number\\nand species of pest aphids within the grain crops varied over the\\nseason, how their associated parasitoid wasp species and numbers varied\\nover time, and how these organisms interacted at crop edges. In our\\nstudy, aphid numbers remained low early in the season, and increased as\\nthe crop growth progressed. Wheat field edges can act as reservoirs for\\nthe aphids and wasps; however, this was not the case for canola field\\nedges, likely due to the different plant hosts available. One wasp\\ndominated this study throughout the canola fields, although it was only\\nfound in low numbers at field edges and in wheat fields. Within these\\nareas, another wasp dominated. These findings can assist in the\\nmanagement of grain aphid pests.\\nIn grain crops, aphids are important pests, but they can be suppressed\\nby hymenopteran parasitoids. A challenge in incorporating parasitoids\\ninto Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs, however, is that\\nparasitoid numbers can be low during periods within the season when\\naphids are most damaging. Understanding the population dynamics of key\\naphid species and their parasitoids is central to ameliorating this\\nproblem. To examine the composition and seasonal trends of both aphid\\nand parasitoid populations in south-eastern Australia, samples were\\ntaken throughout the winter growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 in 28\\nfields of wheat and canola. Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was the most\\nabundant aphid species, particularly within canola crops. Across all\\nfields, aphid populations remained relatively low during the early\\nstages of crop growth and increased as the season progressed. Seasonal\\npatterns were consistent across sites, due to climate, crop growth\\nstage, and interactions between these factors. For canola, field edges\\ndid not appear to act as reservoirs for either aphids or parasitoids, as\\nthere was little overlap in the community composition of either, but for\\nwheat there was much similarity. This is likely due to the presence of\\nsimilar host plants within field edges and the neighbouring crop,\\nenabling the same aphid species to persist within both areas.\\nDiaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) was the most common parasitoid across our\\nstudy, particularly in canola, yet was present only in low abundance at\\nfield edges. The most common parasitoid in wheat fields was Aphidius\\nmatricariae (Haliday), with field edges likely acting as a reservoir for\\nthis species. Secondary parasitoid numbers were consistently low across\\nour study. Differences in parasitoid species composition are discussed\\nin relation to crop type, inter-field variation, and aphid host.

              "  \"Recent climate change has brought new patterns of extreme events in\\nterms of both drought and heavy rainfall to the drought-prone African\\nSahel. The effects of these recent extreme events on the performance of\\nthe Sahel farming systems are still weakly investigated. This study aims\\nat assessing effects of droughts versus floods on crop yield levels and\\nlosses, focusing on the so-called recovery period, particularly\\n2001-2020. A newly developed productivity-drought condition index (PDCI)\\nis utilized to assess agricultural productivity as related to drought or\\nflood in a highly vulnerable region, that is, the Sudanese Sahel. Four\\nfarming systems, namely traditional rainfed, mechanized rainfed, gravity\\nirrigated and spate irrigated systems, with sorghum and millet as staple\\nfood crops, are considered. The PDCI is defined as a function of the\\nintegrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI) over the\\ngrowing season. To address temporal and spatial variabilities, scaling\\nof the PDCI is done in two dimensions: space and time. Crop statistics\\nare used to derive yield losses. Our results show that both drought and\\nflood episodes (seven and six episodes, respectively) can be captured\\nusing the PDCI. Drought remains the most relevant risk to Sahel's crop\\nproductivity. Some recent large-scale floods led to yield loss. However,\\nfloods cause smaller risks to agricultural productivity compared to\\ndroughts. Floods may even result in enhanced crop yields. Based upon\\nscaling in the time or space domain, ranking the severity of drought\\nimpacts on crop yield for individual years from 2001 to 2020 reveals\\nleast to slightly different results. Vulnerability to drought depends on\\nthe crop type and farming system. Drought effect on crop yield from the\\nirrigated sector is clear on individual years but not as a general\\nstatistical relationship. The parameter `percentage area under drought'\\nexplains around one-third of the variation in the rainfed crop yield.\\nThe spate irrigation scheme, the gravity irrigated system and the\\nrainfed farmlands experienced respectively 87\\\\%, 57\\\\% and 46\\\\% of area\\nunder drought on average. Irrigated systems produce much higher crop\\nyields than rainfed systems. The mechanized system is more\\ndrought-vulnerable than the traditional system. These results call for\\nidentifying agricultural management pathways that recognize the combined\\nimplications of both hydrological extremes for the region's food\\nsecurity.\\nA newly devised productivity-drought condition index (PDCI) based on\\nintegrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI) data is used\\nto capture the performance of different Sahel farming systems. The\\nperformance is evaluated spatially and temporally in a comparative study\\nof effects of drought versus floods on crop yield levels and losses\\nduring 2001-2020. Our research shows that: Crop productivity of all\\nfarming systems is severely affected by drought; Flood events can also\\nlead to a decline in productivity, but usually to a much lesser extent;\\nThe vulnerability to droughts and floods depends upon the farming system\\nand crop type. Our analysis shows that the farming systems in the\\nSudanese Sahel have not reverted to conditions that could be described\\nas a Sahel recovery. This study calls for agricultural management\\ndecisions, which are specific for the different farming systems, in\\nresponse to climate variability.image\",\n",

              "  \"Semantic similarity is applied for many areas in Natural Language\\nProcessing, such as information retrieval, text classification,\\nplagiarism detection, and others. Many researchers used semantic\\nsimilarity for English texts, but few used for Arabic due to the\\nambiguity of Arabic concepts in both sense and morphology. Therefore,\\nthe first contribution in this paper is developing a semantic similarity\\napproach between Arabic sentences. Nowadays, the world faces a global\\nproblem of coronavirus disease. In light of these circumstances and\\ndistancing's imposition, it is difficult for farmers to physically\\ncommunicate with agricultural experts to provide advice and find\\nsuitable solutions for their agricultural complaints. In addition,\\ntraditional practices still are used by most farmers. Thus, our second\\ncontribution is helping the farmers solve their Arabic agricultural\\ncomplaints using our proposed approach. The Latent Semantic Analysis\\napproach is applied to retrieve the most problem-related semantic to a\\nfarmer's complaint and find the related solution for the farmer. Two\\nmethods are used in this approach as a weighting schema for data\\nrepresentation are Term Frequency and Term Frequency-Inverse Document\\nFrequency. The proposed model has also classified the big agricultural\\ndataset and the submitted farmer complaint according to the crop type\\nusing MapReduce Support Vector Machine to improve the performance of\\nsemantic similarity results. The proposed approach's performance with\\nTerm Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency-based Latent Semantic Analysis\\nachieved better than its counterparts with an F-measure of 86.7\\\\%.\",\n",

Significant differences in level and temporal\\npattern of transcription, as well as in protein function, of these\\nhomoeologous may have resulted from sequence variation in the promoter\\nas well as in the coding region. Apart from two insertions of 527 bp and\\n2002 bp in the promoter of BnaCO.C9 that function as transcriptional\\nenhancers, this gene is otherwise highly conserved in both promoter and\\ncoding region. However, BnaCO.A10 was classified into two haplotypes and\\ntransgene analysis in Arabidopsis and backcross analysis in rapeseed\\nindicated that the winter-type haplotype had a greater effect in\\npromoting flowering than the spring type.

The\\ntraditional way of manual land evaluation is time-consuming, costlier,\\nrequires expert knowledge, and prone to human errors. The application of\\nmachine learning is making its impact on almost every field. To overcome\\nthe challenges of manual land evaluation automated approach of machine\\nlearning can play an influential role in agriculture. Therefore, the\\npresent study aimed to investigate and propose an automated solution for\\nagricultural land suitability evaluation for two major crops, i.e.,\\nwheat and mustered, based on a hybrid approach of multicriteria decision\\nanalysis (MCDA) and machine learning (ML). The proposed framework is\\nbased on the land suitability assessment framework proposed by the Food\\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO). For evaluating suitability levels of\\nland units, three major influential categories of geospatial parameters\\nare considered, i.e., soil, climatic, and topographic. The MCDA\\ntechnique of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to analyze\\ncrop suitability utilizing these geospatial parameters. The ML models\\nare constructed to map the quantified crop suitability results and\\nsuggest the most suitable crop to be cultivated. The obtained results\\nindicate that the Balanced Bagging classifier achieved the highest\\nbalanced accuracies of 97.69\\\\% and 97.57\\\\% for mustered and wheat crop\\nsuitability predictions, respectively, and a balanced accuracy of\\n97.36\\\\% for crop classification. Since the AHP method is a systematic\\napproach to decision analysis, while ML is a data-driven approach, the\\nproposed unified approach offers more comprehensive predictions. The\\npotential of the proposed framework is evaluated for the Abhanpur\\ndistrict of Chhattisgarh state, India.

This makes it extremely difficult to apply the\\noptical remote sensing methodologies for groundnut discrimination and\\nacreage estimation. We develop a remote sensing strategy based on\\ntimeseries synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which is immune to\\nthe rainy conditions of the observation period. Further, our work is\\ndistinct from the traditional multitemporal SAR backscatter analysis as\\nit incorporates polarimetric parameters such as the alpha angle (a) and\\nthe polarimetric radar vegetation index to aid discrimination. These\\nparameters were shortlisted on the basis of maximal sensitivity to\\ngroundnut growth stages. Random forest classifier, an ensemble\\nlearning-based classifier, is used to carryout the crop classification\\nusing these parameters. This approach is contrasted with SAR\\nbackscatter-based analysis (using the same RF classifier) and with a\\nEuclidean distance (ED)-based model matching method (with the same\\npolarimetric parameters). A detailed comparative analysis of\\nclassification accuracy of groundnut discrimination is carried out using\\nextensive ground truth data over the agricultural fields of Junagadh\\ndistrict in the Gujarat state of Western India.

Based on the difference in feature vectors before and after\\nlodging, a lodging grade monitoring model based on rice parcels was\\nconstructed, and the accuracy of the model was verified using field\\nobservations. The results showed that the spectral reflectance of the\\nrice canopy after lodging increased with the increase in lodging stress.\\nThe difference in vegetation index before and after lodging increased\\nwith the increase in lodging severity.

Understanding the\\ndriving forces of the underlying causes of this low NUE is thus crucial\\nto improve nitrogen use and reduce losses in China. Here we applied the\\nCHANS model to estimate cropland NUE for over 2800 counties in China for\\nthe year 2017. Results showed that in most counties NUE ranged between\\n20\\\\% and 40\\\\%, while an NUE >50\\\\% was mainly found in Northeastern\\nChina, likely as a result of large-scale, modern agriculture operations.\\nThe source of N input and crop types significantly affected NUE in our\\nassessment. Nitrogen deposition, straw recycling, and biological\\nnitrogen fixation (BNF) could improve NUE, while chemical nitrogen\\nfertilizer and manure inputs reduce NUE. Grain crops have a much higher\\nNUE compared to vegetables, which are often over-fertilized.

The method\\nemploys the Hilbert-Huang transform-analysis method to obtain\\ntime-frequency spectrum characteristics of the blocking process, thus\\ndiagnosing the speed reduction necessary to shut down when the threshing\\ndrum is clogged. The traditional method of extracting fault\\ncharacteristic frequency by Fourier transform is compared with the\\nproposed method. This method can not only diagnose the critical value of\\nthe rotating speed when the drum is clogged but also accurately and\\nclearly reflect the trend of the drum clogging fault. The fault is\\nwithin 3 standard deviations above or below the mean characteristic\\nfrequency, and abnormality is with in 1 standard deviation above or\\nbelow the mean characteristic frequency. Based on our experimental\\nanalysis, we introduce the concept of the confidence interval, and we\\nconsider crop type and the diversity of working conditions. The proposed\\nmethod improves the adaptability of forecasting to specific environments\\nand combines agricultural machinery with agronomy. The trend of blocking\\ncan be predicted at least 1 s in the early stage of blockage by using a\\nsliding window to process the vibration data collected in real time.\\nThis predictive ability makes the method superior to speed-sensor\\nanalysis in precision.

To\\nevaluate this concern, freshwater and effluent were applied to an open\\nfield that was treated with soil barriers including plastic mulch\\ntogether with surface and subsurface drip irrigation, cultivating\\nfreshly eaten crops (cucumbers or melons) for two consecutive growing\\nseasons. We hypothesized that the effluent carries antibiotics and\\nresistance determinants to the drip-irrigated soil and crops regardless\\nof the treatment. To test our hypothesis, we monitored for antibiotics\\nabundance (erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline,\\nchlortetracycline, oxytetracydine, amoxicillin, and ofloxacin) and their\\ncorresponding resistance genes (ermB, ermF, sul1, tetW, tetO, bla(TEM)\\nand qnrB), together with class 1 integron (intl1), and bacterial 16S\\nrRNA, in water, soil, and crop samples taken over two years of\\ncultivation. The results showed that an array of antibiotics and their\\ncorresponding resistance genes were detected in the effluent but not the\\nfreshwater. Yet, there were no significant differences in the\\ndistribution or abundance of antibiotics and resistance genes,\\nregardless of the irrigation water quality, or crop type (p > 0.05), but\\nplastic-covered soil irrigated with effluent retained the antibiotics\\noxytetracydine and ofloxacin (p < 0.05). However, we could not detect\\nsignificant correlations between the detected antibiotics and the\\ncorresponding resistance genes. Overall, our findings disproved our\\nhypothesis suggesting that treated effluent may not carry antibiotics\\nresistance genes to the irrigated soil and crops yet, plastic mulch\\ncovered soil retain some antibiotics that may inflict long term\\ncontamination.

The Ortolan Bunting\\nEmberiza hortulana has suffered one of the most severe declines among\\nfarmland specialists. In order to maintain viable populations of the\\nspecies in the long run, there is a vital need for evidence-based\\nconservation measures. The main goal of this study was to detect the key\\ndrivers of breeding-territory selection and mating success of the\\nspecies in an agricultural landscape in central Europe. We found that\\nthe landscape structure within the territories of Ortolan Bunting\\nbreeding pairs strongly varied from the overall habitat availability in\\nthe study area on both the territory and home-range scales. However, the\\nenvironmental conditions also differed between the territories of\\nbreeding pairs and those of unpaired males. While landscape structure\\nplayed an important role in breeding-territory selection, it had only\\nweak effects on mating success. In contrast, crop type and vegetation\\nheight at potential nesting sites were important drivers of mating\\nsuccess. Overall, our study revealed that Ortolan Bunting has very\\ncomplex breeding-habitat requirements. Only heterogeneous agricultural\\nlandscapes where (1) suitable song posts, (2) appropriate nesting sites,\\nand (3) sufficient foraging habitats occur in close proximity are\\nsuitable for breeding.

Field measurements consisted of the reflectance of flowers,\\nleaves, and soils at the flowering stage and rapeseed yield at\\nphysiological maturity. Moreover, GF-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images\\nwere collected to compare the applicability of yield estimation methods.\\nThe abundance of different organs of rapeseed was extracted by the\\nspectral mixture analysis (SMA) technology, which was multiplied by\\nvegetation indices (VIs) respectively to estimate the yield. ResultsFor\\nthe UAV-scale, the product of VIs and leaf abundance (AbdLF) was closely\\nrelated to rapeseed yield, which was better than the VIs models for\\nyield estimation, with the coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.78.\\nThe yield estimation models of the product of normalized difference\\nyellowness index (NDYI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and AbdLF had\\nthe highest accuracy, with the coefficients of variation (CVs) below\\n10\\\\%. For the satellite scale, most of the estimation models of the\\nproduct of VIs and rapeseed AbdLF were also improved compared with the\\nVIs models. The yield estimation models of the product of AbdLF and\\nrenormalized difference VI (RDVI) and EVI (RDVIxAbdLF and EVIxAbdLF) had\\nthe steady improvement, with CVs below 13.1\\\\%. Furthermore, the yield\\nestimation models of the product of AbdLF and normalized difference VI\\n(NDVI), visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), RDVI, and EVI\\nhad consistent performance at both UAV and satellite scales.\\nDiscussionThe results showed that considering SMA could improve the\\nlimitation of using only VIs to retrieve rapeseed yield at the flowering\\nstage. Our results indicate that the abundance of rapeseed leaves can be\\na potential indicator of yield prediction during the flowering stage.',\n",

An AV system needs\\nto balance the sunlight sharing between the solar panels and crops to\\nmaintain the desired food-energy yields, subject to appropriate\\nconstraints. Given the emerging diversity of monofacial and bifacial\\nfarms, the lack of a standardized crop-specific metric (to evaluate the\\nefficacy of the irradiance sharing) has made it difficult to\\noptimize/assess the performance of AV systems. Here, we introduce a new\\nmetric-light productivity factor (LPF)-that evaluates the effectiveness\\nof irradiance sharing for a given crop type and photovoltaic (PV) array\\ndesign. The metric allows us to identify optimal design parameters\\nincluding the spatial PV array density, panel orientation, and single\\naxis tracking schemes specific to the photosynthetically active\\nradiation needs of the crop. By definition, LPF equals 1 for PV-only or\\ncrop-only systems. The AV systems enhances LPF between 1 and 2 depending\\non the shade sensitivity of the crop, PV array configuration, and the\\nseason. While traditional fixed-tilt systems increase LPF significantly\\nabove 1, we find LPF is maximized at 2 for shade-tolerant crops with a\\nsolar farm based on single axis sun tracking scheme. Among the fixed\\ntilt systems, east/west faced bifacial vertical solar farms is\\nparticularly promising because it produces smallest variability in the\\nseasonal yield for shade sensitive crops, while providing LPF comparable\\nto the standard N/S faced solar farms. Additional benefits include\\nreduced soiling and ease of movement of large-scale combine-harvester\\nand other farming equipment.',\n",

Finding Farms that are small and fragmented lead\\nto the use of large amounts of pesticides in China. For a given crop\\ntype, three factors contribute to a negative relationship between farm\\nsize and pesticide use: the spillover effect from the use of pesticides\\nby other farmers in the same village, the level of mechanization and the\\nmanagement ability of farmers. The first two factors play important\\nroles in the cultivation of grain crops, while the last factor is the\\nmain reason why farmers with larger plots of land use fewer pesticides\\nin the cultivation of vegetables. In addition, the effect of\\nagricultural machinery services on reducing the use of pesticides is\\ncurrently limited, and the service system in China is still\\ninsufficient, which has been pointed out that it is also due to the\\nprevalence of small and fragmented farms.

Then we collected data mainly from public data sources\\nto estimate the inventory for a unit head of each animal category and\\nunit area of each fodder crop type at the subnational level. Using the\\nfodder-livestock interaction and collected data, we calculated the\\nterritorial emission factors for animal land use, which aggregates the\\nlife cycle emissions from unit area of land use containing fodder crops\\nand livestock that these fodder crops feed.

Decomposition days (DD),\\na calculation that factors in temperature and rainfall to estimate\\ncumulative conditions that favor decomposition, were used to normalize\\nclimate conditions across sites and years. Counts of postharvest\\nstanding stems, stem diameters, and residue heights were measured, as\\nwas soil surface coverage. Soil cover measurements were used to estimate\\nthe length of time before soil surface cover fell below a 30\\\\% coverage\\nthreshold and to model residue persistence. Results showed that winter\\nwheat consistently produced more residue cover immediately after\\nharvest, and cover also persisted almost twice as long as forage crop\\nresidues. The hypothesis that residue cover could be represented using\\nan exponential decay model was supported for forage sorghum and forage\\nmillet, while wheat residue maintained postharvest coverage of the soil\\nfor a period of time before beginning to decline and followed a\\nquadratic decay model. The combined effects of standing stem density,\\ninitial residue cover, and coverage longevity point to wheat being a\\nvaluable protector against wind erosion in these systems.

Consumers are\\nincreasingly demanding more nutritious food products with less\\nenvironmental degradation, particularly related to water and fertilizer\\nnitrogen (N) inputs. While triticale (x Triticosecale) is often\\nreferenced as having superior abiotic stress tolerance compared to\\nwheat, few studies have compared crop productivity and resource use\\nefficiencies under a range of N-and water-limited conditions. Because\\nprevious work has shown that blending wheat with triticale in a 40:60\\nratio can yield acceptable and more nutritious baked products, we tested\\nthe hypothesis that increasing the use of triticale grain in the baking\\nsupply chain would reduce the environmental footprint for water and N\\nfertilizer use. Using a dataset comprised of 37 site-years encompassing\\nnormal and stress-induced environments in California, we assessed yield,\\nyield stability, and the efficiency of water and fertilizer N use for 67\\nand 17 commercial varieties of wheat and triticale, respectively.

The analysis was performed using C-band time series\\ndata derived from the Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite and two L-band images\\nfrom the PALSAR-2 (ALOS-2) sensor acquired over irrigated grassland\\nplots in the Crau plain of southeast France. The S1 C-band time series\\nwas first analyzed as a function of rainfall and irrigation events. The\\nbackscattering coefficients in both the L and C bands were then compared\\nto the time difference between the date of the acquired SAR image and\\nthe date of the last irrigation event occurring before the SAR\\nacquisition (Delta t). Sensitivity analysis was performed for 2 classes\\nof the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI <= 0.7 and NDVI >\\n0.7). The main results showed that when the vegetation is moderately\\ndeveloped (NDVI <= 0.7), the C-band temporal variation remains sensitive\\nto the soil moisture dynamics and the irrigation events could be\\ndetected. The C-VV signal decreases due to the drying out of the soil\\nwhen the time difference between the S1 image and irrigation event\\nincreases. For well-developed vegetation cover (NDVI > 0.7), the C-band\\nsensitivity to irrigation events becomes dependent on the crop type. For\\nwell-developed Gramineae grass with longs stalks and seedheads, the C\\nband shows no correlation with Delta t due to the absence of the soil\\ncontribution in the backscattered signal, contrary to the legume grass\\ntype, where the C band shows a good correspondence between C-VV and\\nDelta t for NDVI > 0.7. In contrast, analysis of the L-band\\nbackscattering coefficient shows that the L band remains sensitive to\\nthe soil moisture regardless of the vegetation cover development and the\\nvegetation characteristics, thus being more suitable for irrigation\\ndetection than the C band. The L-HH signal over Gramineae grass or\\nlegume grass types shows the same decreasing pattern with the increase\\nin Delta t, regardless of the NDVI-values, presenting a decrease in soil\\nmoisture with time and thus high sensitivity of the radar signal to soil\\nparameters.

AV is\\nthe simultaneous use of land area for photovoltaic (PV) power generation\\nand crop production. Crops are grown under elevated and fully opaque\\nsolar panels so that the degree of shade and transmissible wavelengths\\ncan be partly controlled. The premise of AV rests on the fact that\\nplants require light to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere so as\\nto produce biomass (including fruits, green leaves, roots, etc...). This\\nprocess, known as photosynthesis, exhibits a saturation behavior-meaning\\nbeyond some light level, increasing light does not enhance by much plant\\nuptake of carbon dioxide molecules from the atmosphere. In the process\\nof capturing one carbon dioxide molecule, plants also loose some 400\\nwater molecules from their leaves, a process labeled as transpiration,\\nthereby necessitating sustained water replenishment to the leaf from the\\nsoil. The theoretical premise of AV is that the ``excess light{''} not\\nused in photosynthesis may be used for energy production. Moreover, the\\nevaporative cooling offered by transpiration can enhance the efficiency\\nof solar panels to convert light to energy generation. Thus, the\\nchallenge to AV is how to utilize these principles for maximizing crop\\nproductivity, minimizing transpiration losses to reduce irrigation\\nneeds, and maximizing photovoltaic energy generation. A necessary first\\nstep to address this challenge requires the mathematical quantification\\nof how crops utilize the various wavelengths of light in photosynthesis\\nand, eventually, how these assimilated carbon dioxide molecules are\\nconverted to crop yield. This commentary deals with aspects of this\\nconversion using a mathematical framework known as dynamical systems\\nwhere key dimensionless numbers that act as control parameter in future\\ndesigns are identified.\",\n",

The effects of these recent extreme events on the performance of\\nthe Sahel farming systems are still weakly investigated. This study aims\\nat assessing effects of droughts versus floods on crop yield levels and\\nlosses, focusing on the so-called recovery period, particularly\\n2001-2020. A newly developed productivity-drought condition index (PDCI)\\nis utilized to assess agricultural productivity as related to drought or\\nflood in a highly vulnerable region, that is, the Sudanese Sahel. Four\\nfarming systems, namely traditional rainfed, mechanized rainfed, gravity\\nirrigated and spate irrigated systems, with sorghum and millet as staple\\nfood crops, are considered. The PDCI is defined as a function of the\\nintegrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI) over the\\ngrowing season. To address temporal and spatial variabilities, scaling\\nof the PDCI is done in two dimensions: space and time. Crop statistics\\nare used to derive yield losses. Our results show that both drought and\\nflood episodes (seven and six episodes, respectively) can be captured\\nusing the PDCI. Drought remains the most relevant risk to Sahel's crop\\nproductivity. Some recent large-scale floods led to yield loss. However,\\nfloods cause smaller risks to agricultural productivity compared to\\ndroughts. Floods may even result in enhanced crop yields. Based upon\\nscaling in the time or space domain, ranking the severity of drought\\nimpacts on crop yield for individual years from 2001 to 2020 reveals\\nleast to slightly different results. Vulnerability to drought depends on\\nthe crop type and farming system. Drought effect on crop yield from the\\nirrigated sector is clear on individual years but not as a general\\nstatistical relationship. The parameter `percentage area under drought'\\nexplains around one-third of the variation in the rainfed crop yield.\\nThe spate irrigation scheme, the gravity irrigated system and the\\nrainfed farmlands experienced respectively 87\\\\%, 57\\\\% and 46\\\\% of area\\nunder drought on average. Irrigated systems produce much higher crop\\nyields than rainfed systems. The mechanized system is more\\ndrought-vulnerable than the traditional system. These results call for\\nidentifying agricultural management pathways that recognize the combined\\nimplications of both hydrological extremes for the region's food\\nsecurity.\\nA newly devised productivity-drought condition index (PDCI) based on\\nintegrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI) data is used\\nto capture the performance of different Sahel farming systems. The\\nperformance is evaluated spatially and temporally in a comparative study\\nof effects of drought versus floods on crop yield levels and losses\\nduring 2001-2020. Our research shows that: Crop productivity of all\\nfarming systems is severely affected by drought; Flood events can also\\nlead to a decline in productivity, but usually to a much lesser extent;\\nThe vulnerability to droughts and floods depends upon the farming system\\nand crop type. Our analysis shows that the farming systems in the\\nSudanese Sahel have not reverted to conditions that could be described\\nas a Sahel recovery.

Details on site-specific optimum GxM are available in a\\nweb application at https://ls40.pef.czu.cz/maps/. To enable the use of\\nthe study outputs for certain applications (e.g. breeding), we separated\\nthe examined geographies based on similarities in optimum production\\ncharacteristics and similarities in system response to GxM interventions\\ninto four ``homogeneous system units `` (HSU; i. e. geographical units\\nwithin which reduced GxM interactions are expected). These HSUs intended\\nto offer geography-specific targets to prioritize, test, and introduce\\ndistinct GxM interventions. We conclude that the APSIM-powered framework\\npresented provides region-specific Genotype x Management options that\\ncould become a blueprint for defining quantitative breeding targets that\\nachieve enhanced productivity/ stability of dry-season sorghum\\ncultivation throughout India.'], ['Occurrence, distribution, and driving factors of current-use pesticides\\nin commonly cultivated crops and their potential risks to non-target\\norganisms: A case study in Hainan, China', \"Multiple pesticides are heavily applied in crops grown in China's\\ntropics due to the prevalence of diseases and pests, thus posing\\npotential risks to nontarget organisms (e.g., honeybees, lacewings,\\nladybugs, and humans). However, there is little information on this\\ntopic. This study is the first assessment of the occurrence, driving\\nfactors, and ecological/human health risks of 32 current-use pesticides\\n(CUPs) in 10 frequently-planted crops collected from practicing\\nrice-vegetable rotation systems in Hainan, China. Of the 132 whole crop\\nsamples, 44 (33.3 \\\\%) residues from >= 8 pesticides were detected in\\n9.09 \\\\% of crop samples with concentrations >= 0.5 mg kg(-1).

Remote sensing\\nmakes available NDVI data over large areas, and researchers developed\\nspecific equations to derive the LAI from the NDVI, using empirical\\nrelationships grounded in field data collection. We conducted a\\nliterature search using ``NDVI{''} AND ``LAI{''} AND ``crop{''} as the\\nsearch string, focusing on the period 2017-2021. We reviewed the\\navailable equations to convert the NDVI into the LAI, aiming at (i)\\nexploring the fields of application of an NDVI-based LAI, (ii)\\ncharacterizing the mathematical relationships between the NDVI and LAI\\nin the available equations, (iii) creating a software library with the\\nretrieved methods, and (iv) releasing a publicly available software as a\\nservice, implementing these equations to foster their reuse by third\\nparties. The literature search yielded 92 articles since 2017, where 139\\nequations were proposed. We analyzed the mathematical form of both the\\nsingle equations and ensembles of the NDVI to LAI conversion methods,\\nspecific for crop, sensor, and biome. The characterization of the\\nfunctions highlighted two main constraints when developing an NDVI-LAI\\nconversion function: environmental conditions (i.e., water and light\\nresource, land cover, and climate) and the availability of recurring\\ndata during the growing season. We found that the trend of an NDVI-LAI\\nfunction is usually driven by the ecosystem water availability for the\\ncrop rather than by the crop type itself, as well as by the data\\navailability; the data should be adequate in terms of the sample size\\nand temporal resolution for reliably representing the phenomenon under\\ninvestigation. Our study demonstrated that the choice of the NDVI-LAI\\nequation (or ensemble of equations) should be driven by the trade-off\\nbetween the scale of the investigation and data availability. The\\nimplementation of an extensible and reusable software library publicly\\nqueryable via API represents a valid mean to assist researchers in\\nchoosing the most suitable equations to perform an NDVI-LAI conversion.\"], ['Comparative Analysis of the Sensitivity of SAR Data in C and L Bands for\\nthe Detection of Irrigation Events', 'Comprehensive knowledge about irrigation timing is crucial for water\\nresource management. This paper presents a comparative analysis between\\nC- and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for the detection of\\nirrigation events. The analysis was performed using C-band time series\\ndata derived from the Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite and two L-band images\\nfrom the PALSAR-2 (ALOS-2) sensor acquired over irrigated grassland\\nplots in the Crau plain of southeast France. The S1 C-band time series\\nwas first analyzed as a function of rainfall and irrigation events. The\\nbackscattering coefficients in both the L and C bands were then compared\\nto the time difference between the date of the acquired SAR image and\\nthe date of the last irrigation event occurring before the SAR\\nacquisition (Delta t). Sensitivity analysis was performed for 2 classes\\nof the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI <= 0.7 and NDVI >\\n0.7). The main results showed that when the vegetation is moderately\\ndeveloped (NDVI <= 0.7), the C-band temporal variation remains sensitive\\nto the soil moisture dynamics and the irrigation events could be\\ndetected. The C-VV signal decreases due to the drying out of the soil\\nwhen the time difference between the S1 image and irrigation event\\nincreases. For well-developed vegetation cover (NDVI > 0.7), the C-band\\nsensitivity to irrigation events becomes dependent on the crop type. For\\nwell-developed Gramineae grass with longs stalks and seedheads, the C\\nband shows no correlation with Delta t due to the absence of the soil\\ncontribution in the backscattered signal, contrary to the legume grass\\ntype, where the C band shows a good correspondence between C-VV and\\nDelta t for NDVI > 0.7. In contrast, analysis of the L-band\\nbackscattering coefficient shows that the L band remains sensitive to\\nthe soil moisture regardless of the vegetation cover development and the\\nvegetation characteristics, thus being more suitable for irrigation\\ndetection than the C band. The L-HH signal over Gramineae grass or\\nlegume grass types shows the same decreasing pattern with the increase\\nin Delta t, regardless of the NDVI-values, presenting a decrease in soil\\nmoisture with time and thus high sensitivity of the radar signal to soil\\nparameters. Finally, the co-polarizations for both the C and L bands\\n(L-HH and C-VV) tend to be more adequate for irrigation detection than\\nthe HV cross-polarization, as they show higher sensitivity to soil\\nmoisture values.'], ['New Evidence on the Linkage of Population Trends and Species Traits to\\nLong-Term Niche Changes', \"Simple Summary Temporal changes of ecological niches in relation to both\\npopulation trends and species traits (life-history and ecological\\ncharacteristics) are a poorly investigated topic in animal ecology even\\nthough they can provide crucial information for investigating how\\nspecies respond to ongoing environmental changes.

The premise behind AV is that excess light not used in\\nphotosynthesis can be used for energy production. There are\\nopportunities for maximizing photosynthesis by targeting particular\\nwavelengths (e.g., red) to be transmitted through semi-transparent\\nphotovoltaic (PV) cells depending on crop type and environmental\\nconditions. Camporese and Abou Najm (2022, https://doi.\\norg/10.1029/2022EF002900) developed a numerical model that accommodates\\nthe various wavelengths of the incoming light spectrum to predict\\nphotosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. This commentary\\nseeks to place those and other recent findings about the modifications\\nto the plant micro-environment by PV cells in the context of maximum\\nattainable aboveground biomass.\\nPlain Language Summary With high demands for electricity and reduced\\ncosts of solar panel manufacturing, competition for arable land between\\nsolar energy production and crops comes as no surprise. A possible way\\nforward to ameliorate the adverse effects of such competition is a\\nsolution labeled as Agriphotovoltaics or simply Agrivoltaics (AV). AV is\\nthe simultaneous use of land area for photovoltaic (PV) power generation\\nand crop production. Crops are grown under elevated and fully opaque\\nsolar panels so that the degree of shade and transmissible wavelengths\\ncan be partly controlled. The premise of AV rests on the fact that\\nplants require light to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere so as\\nto produce biomass (including fruits, green leaves, roots, etc...). This\\nprocess, known as photosynthesis, exhibits a saturation behavior-meaning\\nbeyond some light level, increasing light does not enhance by much plant\\nuptake of carbon dioxide molecules from the atmosphere. In the process\\nof capturing one carbon dioxide molecule, plants also loose some 400\\nwater molecules from their leaves, a process labeled as transpiration,\\nthereby necessitating sustained water replenishment to the leaf from the\\nsoil. The theoretical premise of AV is that the ``excess light{''} not\\nused in photosynthesis may be used for energy production. Moreover, the\\nevaporative cooling offered by transpiration can enhance the efficiency\\nof solar panels to convert light to energy generation. Thus, the\\nchallenge to AV is how to utilize these principles for maximizing crop\\nproductivity, minimizing transpiration losses to reduce irrigation\\nneeds, and maximizing photovoltaic energy generation. A necessary first\\nstep to address this challenge requires the mathematical quantification\\nof how crops utilize the various wavelengths of light in photosynthesis\\nand, eventually, how these assimilated carbon dioxide molecules are\\nconverted to crop yield. This commentary deals with aspects of this\\nconversion using a mathematical framework known as dynamical systems\\nwhere key dimensionless numbers that act as control parameter in future\\ndesigns are identified.\"]]\n"
